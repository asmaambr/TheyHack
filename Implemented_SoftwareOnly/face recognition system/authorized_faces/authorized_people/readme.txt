Face Recognition Access Control System
Overview
This project implements a real-time face recognition system to control access to secured environments (e.g., server rooms or restricted facilities). It uses a webcam feed to capture faces and compares them against a local database of authorized individuals using the DeepFace facial recognition framework.

If a match is found, access is granted; otherwise, it is denied. The system is lightweight, fast, and suitable for integration into IoT or security-based applications.

Features
Real-time face recognition using a webcam

Local folder of authorized faces

Access granted/denied feedback with live display

Uses DeepFace for facial comparison

Compatible with standard webcams, we could not test the software since the camera didn't work, it was givoing corrupted output
