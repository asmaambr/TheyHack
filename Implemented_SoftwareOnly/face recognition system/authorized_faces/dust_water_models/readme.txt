# Dust & Water Leak Detection Models

This project contains two machine learning models built using the Random Forest Classifier to help detect environmental hazards:

- **Dust Alert Detection Model**  
- **Water Leak Detection Model**

Both models are trained on synthetically generated data and can be integrated into smart server rooms or IoT-based environmental monitoring systems.we could not test the software since we didn't have access to some hardware components like the dust and the water sensor
